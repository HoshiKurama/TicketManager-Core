# TicketManager Core
TicketManager Core (TM:Core) is a new and required part of the TicketManager ecosystem. It provides a critical decoupling of the components developers use and the functionality TM:SE provides. This has different implications depending on the user type:
- End Users: TM:Core allows developers to make much more than previously possible.
- Developers: TM:Core contains the API, implementations, and entry points used by TM:SE. It additionally contains the Kotlin libraries that Kotlin developers will need to use.
